# Gold Price Volatility Modeling with GARCH(1,1)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes **daily gold price data** and models its volatility using a **GARCH(1,1)** framework.  
The aim is to study volatility clustering in financial time series through **data visualization, statistical tests, and time series modeling**.

The workflow includes:
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Import daily gold price data from Kaggle datasets.  
2. **Preprocessing & Returns Calculation** â€“ Clean and transform prices into log/percentage returns.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Summary statistics, skewness, kurtosis, and normality checks.  
4. **Time Series Analysis** â€“ Autocorrelation plots (ACF/PACF), ARCH effect testing.  
5. **Volatility Modeling** â€“ Fit a **GARCH(1,1)** model.  
6. **Visualization & Insights** â€“ Plot volatility against returns and interpret results.
